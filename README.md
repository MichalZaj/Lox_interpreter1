Implementation of the Lox programming language from the textbook: [*Crafting Interpreters* by Robert Nystrom](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) in C#.

# Chapter Progress
- The "Chapter_progress" folder contains the code for each chapter completed in the textbook. 
- The "Chapter_documentation" has text files for each chapter on progress made throughout the development. The text files include information on what was learned, what was implemented, and tests done.
